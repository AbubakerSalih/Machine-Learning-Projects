# ML Beginner Projects

## Projects

1. **Diabetes Prediction**  
   Predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on health data.

2. **Rock vs Mine Classification**  
   Classifies sonar reads as rock or mine.

3. **Spam Mail Detection**  
   Classifies an email as spam or not based on text classification.

4. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Recognizes credit card fraud based on the behavior of credit card usage. 

5. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   Whether a person has a heart disease or not.

6. **House Price Prediction**
   Predict the price of the houses.

7. **Loan Status Prediction**
   Approval or rejection of the loan.

8. **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**
Predict bike rentals based on weather and time attributes.

9. **Custom vs Sklearn Linear Regression on Student Exam Data**
   Predicts student math grades using linear regression. This project contrasts a customLinear regression model (i.e., implemented from scratch) with Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` to see how they compare in terms of performance.

10. **Real vs Fake Job Posting Detection (Custom vs Sklearn Logistic Regression)**
*Identifies spam job postings with text and binary features.*
   
    I merged  job description columns into one `text` column then used  **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to transform the text into numerical features . the datset was **strongly imbalanced** so undersampling was done to balance the classes. I made a logistic regression model from scratch and compared it to the one from sklearn. finally I made bar charts to compare the accuracy between the two.

11. **Custom vs Library SVM: Performance Comparison on Breast Cancer Dataset**
    I implemented a SVM from scratch and used it on breast cancer dataset.I compared its accuracy with the accuracy of the SVM from Scikit-learn . Suprisingly,my custom model performed slightly better.
